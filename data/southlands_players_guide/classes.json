                "desc": "The quest to reclaim Haldaheim has brought some rogues into contact with the spirits of long-dead dwarven ancestors there. By accepting the burden of the spirit's grudges, they gain a knowledgeable, if eerie, ally.\n\n#### Spirit Ally\nAt 3rd level when you choose this archetype, the spirit of an ancient dwarf joins with you. Work with your GM to create a name and personality for the spirit. You gain a number of the spirit's capabilities from when it was alive.\n- You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. If you already have darkvision, the range of your darkvision increases by 30 feet.\n- You gain proficiency in medium armor, and wearing medium armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks. You can add 3, rather than 2, to your Armor Class while wearing medium armor if your Dexterity is 16 or higher.\n- You speak, read, and write Dwarvish and Deep Speech.\n\n#### Long Memory for Grudges\nAlso at 3rd level, your spirit ally helps you settle scores. You gain advantage on your first attack roll against a creature that dealt damage to you, or that you saw deal damage to any dwarf or another creature that you are friendly toward. On a hit, you deal an additional 1d6 necrotic damage. Once you do, you can't choose to knock that creature unconscious if you reduce them to 0 hit points. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain one expended use for each Hit Die you expend to regain hit points and all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n#### Wandering Soul\nStarting at 9th level, your spirit ally can aid in your scouting. As a bonus action, you can see creatures and objects that are in the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet while you are in the Material Plane, and vice versa, until the end of your next turn.\nAs an action, your spirit ally can look through objects up to 5 feet thick and report what it sees. It shares your bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks and darkvision, and it can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane.\n\n#### Stone Mind\nBeginning at 13th level, you learn to block out the whispers in the darkness that shatter the minds of lesser adventurers. You gain resistance to psychic damage.\nAs a reaction, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see takes psychic damage, you can halve the damage that creature takes.\n\n#### Inescapable Vengeance\nStarting at 17th level, as a bonus action, you can become invisible until the beginning of your next turn. Until this effect ends, you can pass through creatures and solid objects. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn in the same space as another creature or solid object. The first time you hit with a weapon attack, you deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage.\nYou can use this feature once and regain use of it when you expend a use of Long Memory for Grudges and when you finish a long rest."

                "name": "Farseer",
                "desc": "Your magic comes from a god of prophecy and prognostication who imbued a sliver of its power in your ancestry. Farseers can trace their power through the generations to a single, powerful ancestor whose divine gift gave them access to the webs of fate. Others are plagued by visions and omens with no knowledge of their august lineage. These unfortunate men and women may be driven to madness and ostracized by their uncontrolled, forbidden knowledge. Regardless, the touch of the divine has forever changed you and the skeins of fate unravel in your view. Except as noted below, farseers function as sorcerers and use the sorcerer spell list.\n\n#### Blood of the Seer\nWhen you choose this origin at 1st level, the blood of your ancestors signals your destiny. You become proficient in Insight and History. Your preternatural sense of what is to come also allows you to sense imminent danger, so you make initiative checks with advantage.\n\n#### Quickening\nAt 1st level, you can take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. You can do this a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). You regain expended uses after finishing a long or short rest.\n\n#### Commune with the Unknown\nUpon reaching 6th level, your prophetic insight allows you to commune with otherworldly powers. By focusing all your attention on a single yes-or-no question for 1 minute, you can pose that question to the powers beyond. The entity that responds to your question has vast knowledge of everything that has happened and of everything that is likely to happen. It isn't omniscient, however; it can predict the future only in terms of what may happen, not what's certain to happen. Questions about the future must be phrased in terms of what's possible or plausible to avoid non-answers. You must finish a short or long rest before communing with the unknown again.\n\n#### Time Slip\nBeginning at 14th level, the skeins of time enshroud your body, distorting the fabric of reality around you. As an action, you can expend 3 sorcery points to step out of sync with probable futures. You can be seen only as an indistinct, shimmery outline. Attacks against you are made with disadvantage and you have resistance against nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Additionally, you can move through other creatures and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside a solid object, you take 5 (1d10) force damage. The effect lasts for 1 minute, provided you maintain concentration on it as on a spell.\n\n#### Sharing the Dream\nAt 18th level, visions of likely futures constantly weave across your consciousness. You can share that foreknowledge with your companions. As an action, you can grant up to five creatures (which can include yourself) advantage on attack rolls or saving throws (each creature chooses for itself) for 1 minute, provided you maintain concentration on this effect as on a spell. You must expend 2 sorcery points per affected creature to trigger this effect."

                "name": "School of Desiderites",
                "desc": "Desiderites seek to alter reality as effortlessly as the jinn. To master the magic of granting wishes, they create and improve a magic lamp that grants a flexibility other wizards rarely achieve. The weakness of wish magic is that someone else must make the wish the desiderite grants. While some desiderites help others, the greedy or power-hungry keep retainers or servants close at hand to make wishes that benefit the wizard.\n\n#### Disciple of Desires\nAt 2nd level when you choose this school, you learn to read, write, and speak Primordial. You craft a brass ring or lamp that serves as an arcane focus for your spells. If this object is destroyed or lost, you can create another one in 1 hour, using a ritual requiring 25 gp worth of components. \nTo use any of the Desiderite subclass features, you must touch your ring or lamp after a mortal creature other than you within 60 feet of you makes a wish. You must be able to see and hear them utter the wish aloud for the magic to take hold.\n\n#### Small Favors\nStarting at 2nd level, you can grant small wishes to others. When a creature makes a wish regarding an action they are about to take, including an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant their wish for success by adding 1d4 to the roll. You must use this feature before the creature makes its roll. No creature can benefit from this feature more than three times per day.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Once you grant a creature's wish three times with this feature, it can't receive another wish from this feature until the next dawn.\nAt 10th level, you add 1d6 instead.\n\n#### Heart's Desire \nStarting at 6th level, you can sense the deepest desires of others. You learn detect thoughts (or another divination spell of your choice if you already know that spell), and you can cast it without components. When you probe deeper into a creature's thoughts, you learn one thing it sincerely wishes for, even if it succeeds on its Wisdom saving throw.\n\n#### Desperate Wish\nBeginning at 10th level, you can answer the wish of an ally in dire need. When a creature you can see and hear within 60 feet of you drops to 0 hit points but is not instantly killed, it can call out to you, and you can use your reaction to cause it to drop to 1 hit point instead, teleport to a space within 5 feet of you, and gain immunity to all damage until the start of its next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest or you expend a 5-level spell slot to regain the use of this feature.\n\n#### Wishmaster\nAt 14th level, you can grant most wishes by duplicating the effect of other spells. When a creature makes a wish, you can rub your lamp as an action to grant their wish. You can duplicate any spell, even those you do not know or are not on your spell list, by expending a spell slot two levels higher than the level of the spell you wish to duplicate.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest."
